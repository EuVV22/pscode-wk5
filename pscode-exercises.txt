// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

ask for number1
save input as number1
ask for number2
save input as number2
add number1 and number2 save result
display result on screen

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for number input
save number input as Number
devide Number by 2 and save result as Result
if Result have decimal positions
display Number " is odd"
else
display Number " is even"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 

ask user to input numbers one by one  
save each number in a data structure Numbers[0 to 4]

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
save 0 as Total
go to each number in Numbers[] and add the number to Total save the result as Total
devide Total by the amount on numbers in Numbers[] (5) save the result as Average



c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

save the first number in Numbers[] as MinimunValue
save the first number in Numbers[] as MaximunValue

go to each number in Numbers and check if it is smaller than MinimumValue
if a number is smaller than MinimunValue
save number as MinimunValue

go to each number in Numbers and check if it is larger that MaximunValue
if number is larger than MaximunValue
save number as MaximunValue

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

display "The average of the collection of numbers is" Average
display "The smaller number is" MinimunValue
display "The largest number is" MaximunValue
